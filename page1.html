      The Ford Model T changed the American way of life forever. It was the first vehicle that was cheap enough to be purchased by middle class workers. Henry Ford used an assembly line an mass produced interchangable parts which dropped the price significantly. Vehicles made before the Model T were very expensive and only purchasable by those in the upper class, the most prominent company being Mercedes Benz.
