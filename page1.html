      The Ford Model T is an icon that marked a change in transportation. The Ford Model T was created by Henry Ford and it first debuted on October 1, 1908. It was the first vehicle that was cheap enough to be purchased by middle class workers. Back then it cost about $800 which roughly translates to $18,000 today. His goal was to bring down the cost of the car so that more people could purchase one. He utilized an assembly line and mass production of interchangeable parts to significantly lower the price of the car. Vehicles made before the Model T were very expensive and only purchasable by those in the upper class, the most prominent company being Mercedes Benz. With the car being available to more people, it changed the American way of life. It provided a way for people to easily transport lots of goods from point A to point B. It could even easily carry the entire family anywhere. Anything that could be hauled by a horse and carriage could be hauled by a Model T. While other versions of the Model T did not come out until later, companies began selling fabrication kits in order to allow owners to modify their Model T to their own needs. Some fabrication kits included a kit to plow a field and a tractor conversion kit. In this exhibition I will be showcasing how the Model T changed transportation and the American way of life.
