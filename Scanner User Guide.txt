Vault 7 System Scanner
######################
By: Greg Lee


I: Description:
This scanner is built to scan your system and determine if you are vulnerable to the exploits listed in the Vault 7 leak. My scanner determines the system OS and then checks the installed updates on the machine. My script will then output if your system is vulnerable or not.


II: Installation

First download the scripts and supplementary text files. Make sure that all of the files are in the proper directories and subdirectories. This is necessary in order for the script to work.
